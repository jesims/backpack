# Backpack
Clojure(Script) cross-project utilities

# Latest Version

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.jesi/backpack.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.jesi/backpack)

# Versioning

> Backpack versions should follow the **Semver** convention.

With version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Active branches should be suffixed with `-SNAPSHOT` to indicate a work-in-progress and likely to rapidly change

# Testing

All utilities should be written to support both Clojure and ClojureScript with unit tests written in **CLJC** where practical.
 Unit tests can then be run by invoking `backpack.sh test` or `backpack.sh test-cljs` respectively.

## Theme: Animal Safari

All string quotes within test functions should be interesting animal facts; with bonus points for David Attenborough quotes.
